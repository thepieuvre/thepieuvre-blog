We are glad to announce that the code is now open source, under [Eclipse Public License - v 1.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).

All the code is available under: [https://github.com/thepieuvre](https://github.com/thepieuvre)

Some documentation for running the Pieuvre can be found at [https://github.com/thepieuvre/thepieuvre/wiki/Development:-Installation-and-Running](https://github.com/thepieuvre/thepieuvre/wiki/Development:-Installation-and-Running)

All single components are available there:

 * [https://github.com/thepieuvre/thepieuvre](https://github.com/thepieuvre/thepieuvre) (main)
 * [https://github.com/thepieuvre/nlp](https://github.com/thepieuvre/nlp)
 * [https://github.com/thepieuvre/feeder](https://github.com/thepieuvre/feeder)
 * [https://github.com/thepieuvre/chunker](https://github.com/thepieuvre/chunker)
 * [https://github.com/thepieuvre/extractor](https://github.com/thepieuvre/extractor)

It has been always a goal to opening the source code, but we first wanted to have a stable running version. It takes a year for reaching that goal.

The code is not perfect: no documentation and no unit test; we are working to improve that.

Enjoy and contribute!
