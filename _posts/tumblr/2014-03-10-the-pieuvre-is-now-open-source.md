We are glad to announce that the code is now open source, under Eclipse Public License - v 1.0.
All the code is available under: https://github.com/thepieuvre
Some documentation for running the Pieuvre can be found at https://github.com/thepieuvre/thepieuvre/wiki/Development:-Installation-and-Running
All single components are available there:
https://github.com/thepieuvre/thepieuvre (main)
https://github.com/thepieuvre/nlp
https://github.com/thepieuvre/feeder
https://github.com/thepieuvre/chunker
https://github.com/thepieuvre/extractor
It has been always a goal to opening the source code, but we first wanted to have a stable running version. It takes a year for reaching that goal.
The code is not perfect: no documentation and no unit test; we are working to improve that.
Enjoy and contribute!
