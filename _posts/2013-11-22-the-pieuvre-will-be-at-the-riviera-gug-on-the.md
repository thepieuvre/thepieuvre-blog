Abstract of the Talk

Today, the Internet provides so many sources of information, so many topics, so many different opinions, etc. It requires an important time to follow all this information. This project aims to provide a new way of organising and reading information on/of the Internet. 
The Pieuvre organises and finds the information for you, by reading the Internet.

In this talk, we present how Groovy/Grails help for building the Core of the system. The presentation gives also a focus on how we integrate other technologies such as Redis and Python for processing natural language contents.
